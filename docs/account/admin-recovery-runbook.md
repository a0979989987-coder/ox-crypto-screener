# OX admin release recovery

2026-10-02: production v3 migration succeeded per parent; bootstrap remains blocked by connector `Invalid or expired requestState`. Parent read-only check at 09:08 UTC: active admins 0, ordinary_configured false. Do not infer bootstrap success or retry writes through another tool.

## Preserved release

PR #80 stays draft, remote tested head e47aa09. Local branch codex/admin-review-release additionally integrates main a3e47ff (ETF, savings, news and market changes preserved). Local follow-up is not pushed while quota is blocked, because pushes can trigger Vercel preview deployments.

Public bootstrap contains only REPLACE_WITH_VERIFIED_GOOGLE_EMAIL. Real-account bootstrap stays in private Library OX-Admin-production-SQL-v3.zip, library ID libfile_2b498d195140819183f4fc1e2b15240d, version 2. It verifies one confirmed auth.users email, the same verified Google identity email, an existing OX account, and no other active admin. No UID approvals are created. Never paste real account details into public PRs or logs.

## Deployment evidence

Vercel was READY at 2026-10-02 09:19:17 UTC for 0d015454bd1582a54a6e343d13be3b1b2c7b9650, but parent subsequently observed another daily-cap failure at 09:49:26 UTC. A prior successful deployment does not establish current available quota. Functions storage was reported at 9.84/10 GB. Exact quota reset/remaining is unknown; coordinate one consolidated release only after a fresh read-only availability check. Do not push or redeploy automatically.

## Resume only after the blockers are resolved

1. Parent reads current private admin/policy status before any write. If bootstrap is still absent, restore the original connector request state/authorization, then execute the private transactional bootstrap once through that supported route. This agent does not attempt a different tool or duplicate writes.
2. Verify exactly one intended active admin, ordinary_configured true with empty ordinary capabilities, exclusive_uid true, core catalog all_member_features; no new real approvals/audit rows. Verify anonymous RPC false, authenticated RPC true, restricted executor attributes and immutable audit privileges. Do not rerun the successful migration.
3. Read the quota reset/remaining state without starting a deployment. When deployment is available and DB-ready is confirmed, fetch latest main, integrate/retest locally, push one consolidated candidate update, review PR, then merge/release once. Retain latest ETF/news/market features.
4. Confirm the production deployment SHA and READY state, then validate real Google admin session and the account-center admin entry. Open /previews/account-admin/ and read status/records only; guest/member must be rejected and synthetic session buttons must be hidden. Do not approve example UIDs or the owner's saved UID automatically. Email real delivery remains untested until an explicitly initiated email flow is completed.

## Routes and rights

Static admin page switches outside localhost to /api/v1/account/admin-review. Actual api/v1/account/[endpoint].js dispatches to Account handler; provider getUser validates HttpOnly-cookie token, the SDK passes that same member JWT to ox_admin_review_rpc, and the DB rechecks private admin membership. Production transport UI test exercises this actual router/handler/SDK/SQL with synthetic provider data, not a production OAuth success claim.

Account center shows admin entry only after admin status succeeds; epoch guards discard stale role responses. Ordinary approval is recorded with zero added capabilities. Core records all_member_features without admin rights or financial transaction permissions. Current public markets remain public; no gates were added.

## Emergency disable

Use docs/account/admin-release/04-disable.sql only if separately needed: deactivate admins as trusted table owner, SET LOCAL ROLE executor and revoke authenticated RPC, retain claims/approvals/audit. Keep current public market access unchanged. Re-enable only with reviewed owner ACL and intended admin verification.

## Completed local QA

After integrating main a3e47ff: 488/488 full tests, 17/17 native PostgreSQL tests, build 96 assets/171 unique IDs, Account UI (including admin visibility and stale-admin logout response), synthetic local admin UI, and production transport router/handler/SDK/SQL UI all passed. Independent security review passed. These follow-up commits are local only; remote PR #80 remains draft at e47aa09. Google real success is retained from prior validation; Email real login and post-bootstrap production admin acceptance remain untested.

## Email recovery follow-up (local only)

Real evidence: logout returned 204 at 09:33:36 and 09:34:51 UTC. OTP send returned 200 at 09:34:15, followed by 429 on repeated sends; verify/token events occurred before logout. At 09:45:22/29 verify reported One-time token not found and redirected with access_denied/otp_expired. This establishes an invalid email link, not whether it was consumed or expired; switching devices is not a confirmed cause. Real Email login acceptance still requires a newly initiated, unused link and user confirmation after release. Existing Google real success is retained.

Local fixes map direct error fragments as well as callback errors to fixed generic categories, remove raw error URLs, preserve PKCE, open the account center only after a verified callback/session, coalesce repeated email submissions, retain a timestamp-only 60-second same-tab cooldown across reload, and expose HTTP 429 clearly. The cooldown is a click guard, not a promise that provider hourly quota has reset. No automatic resend, real email, credential/template change, user-cookie operation or deployment occurs in these tests. Late session/verification UI responses cannot restore a logged-out user; this synthetic race is not claimed as the real logout cause.
